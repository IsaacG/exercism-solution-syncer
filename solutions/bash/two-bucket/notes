Given two unit (no fractions) buckets of sizes A, B we can have at most max(A, B) unique volumes.
We need to iterate through a series of steps where at each step we arrive at a new volume.

With two buckets, to get from one volume to another we start with an empty bucket and a bucket with volume V_1.
 1.  Optionally transfer the existing water from one bucket to another (if it can hold it with room to spare).
     * This gives us two branches to explore, with different results following.
     * At this stage we got two buckets, one empty (a) and the other partially filled (b).
 2.  Fill the empty bucket A.
 3.  Pour the now-full bucket A into the partially filled bucket B.
 4a. If B is full, empty it out, leaving A partially filled with V_2.
 4b. If B is not full, A is empty, leaving us with B partially filled with V_2.
     * If V_2 is our target, we are done (maybe without needing to empty a full bucket).
 5.  We have now "explored" what volumes we can derive, starting with V_1. Mark V_1 as explored.
 6.  If V_2 was previously explored, do nothing. If it was not explored, add it to the list of volumes to explore.
 7.  We can now repeat this process with each volume in the to_explore list.

The problem starts us out with one bucket, A, full and the other, B, empty. Assume that we never want to empty the initial bucket and fill the other.
This means we can consider that volume=0 and volume=B are not volumes to explore, ie can be pre-marked as explored.
